# HireHub Implementation Guide

## 1. Overview

HireHub is a comprehensive system designed to streamline the hiring process for organizations and applicants. It provides tools for organizations to post jobs, manage hiring stages, and track applicants, while offering applicants the ability to create profiles, apply for jobs, and track their application status. The platform also includes administrative features for managing industry types, job roles, skills, and other metadata.

  - **Load Balancing:** Use a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the application for high availability and scalability.
  - **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch) to track application performance, identify errors, and receive alerts. Set up logging to capture application events.
- **7.2 Implementation Plan:**
  1.  **Staging Environment:** Deploy the application to a staging environment that mirrors the production environment. Conduct thorough testing in the staging environment before deploying to production.
  2.  **Production Deployment:** Deploy the application to the production environment. Use a phased rollout strategy (e.g., canary deployments or blue/green deployments) to minimize downtime and risk.
  3.  **Post-Deployment Monitoring:** Monitor the application closely after deployment to identify any issues and ensure everything is working as expected.

### Phase 8: Post-Launch and Maintenance

- **8.1 Monitoring and Logging:** Continuously monitor the application for performance, errors, and security issues. Analyze logs to identify patterns and troubleshoot problems.
- **8.2 Updates and Maintenance:** Regularly update the application with bug fixes, security patches, and new features. Establish a maintenance schedule for routine tasks like database backups and performance optimization.
